# angular-blog-static
This is a simple cms system, built using angularjs 1.x, I started learning angularjs and understanding how to change from DOM operations to data-driven UI, including ui-router/ng-bootstrap/ng The collaborative work of common components such as -resource basically includes all the form operations and image uploads. I hope this project can also help other newcomers.
